- 👋 Hi, I’m @notAnotherAverageJoe
- 👀 I’m interested in just about every programming language, I have a passion for code and learning.
  It appears that this is a field as wide as the ocean and just as deep.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full-stack development. Embedded programming, OTP, and much more, the learning never stops!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can use my skills to help progress.
